* Main measurement: iterations per second
* WIP Grouping benchmarks manually
* TODO When running multiple runs over multiple benchmarks, randomize the order for each run
* Visualisations
*** DONE Bar-chart for comparing benchamrks to each other
*** TODO Line-chart for comparing one benchmark across time
*** TODO Bar-chart for comparing implementations
* TODO Port to clisp, cmucl, and ccl
  CCL and CMUCL seem happy enough.
* TODO SAVE-BINARY
  A command to save the current implementation under microbench/bin/
